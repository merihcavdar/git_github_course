How to work with remote Repositories:
the only thing you need is an GitHub account

- Drapdown menu -> create a new repository
- give it a name

when created, GitHub will initialize an empty repo
and give you insrtuctions on how to connect to it locally
the only thing we need is the url like "https://github.com/merihcavdar/test-repo.git"

back to VS Code Terminal, run the following command:
"git remote" -> it will show you which remote repo you are connected. (for the time being, it returns nothing which means there is no connection to a remote repo)

so to connect:
"git remote add" followed by 2 values:
1-> the name of the repository which is typically named "origin" because it will serve as the main source of truth for code
2-> the URL to the remote repo (ends with .git) 
"git remote add origin https://github.com/merihcavdar/test-repo.git

run "git remote" again and it will list out "origin"
origin

if you provide "v" after the command, it will also show the URL
"git remote -v"
origin https://github.com/merihcavdar/test-repo.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/merihcavdar/test-repo.git (push)

if you want more information:
"git remote show origin" // it will provide additional information
* remote origin
Fetch URL: https://github.com/merihcavdar/test-repo.git
Push  URL: https://github.com/merihcavdar/test-repo.git
HEAD branch: (unknown)
