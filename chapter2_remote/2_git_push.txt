"push" command... which will take the code on our local repository and upload it or sync it out with the remote repo

when you commit locally, it will not automatically sync up with the remote repo
that's where "PUSH" comes in...

push command requires 2 arguments:
1-> the name of the remote repo
2-> an the branch that you wanna push

when added "-u" flag at the end of the command that sets the origin repo to upstream remote in the git config file

"git push origin master"
"git push origin master -u" -> when the remote repo is the final source of truth.

on GitHub Repo page, the Commits are listed to be analysed
diff between them

use "pencil" icon to edit the file, and commit it on the web version. it comes in handy when you just want to adjust a typo.
but when done so, the remote repository is "one commit ahead" from our local repo.

how to sync up with remote repo?
