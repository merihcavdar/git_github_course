"git pull" is used to combine:
-> fetch
-> merge

when developing software, you ll often pulling down new code from the remote repo

simply:
"git pull origin master"
as "-u" flag is used before
just:
"git pull" is enough.

- if you have uncommited changes in the current directory, 
- and you try to pull down new codes from the remote repo
-> the operation will fail... it will override the current changes...

consider 
- making commit for the current changes on the local
- stashing
- conflict
