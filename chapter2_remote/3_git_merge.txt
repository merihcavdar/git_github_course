we have 
- "master" branch on the remote repository and
- "master" branch on the local repository

the HEADS are at different commits

remote HEAD is one commit AHEAD from the local repo

2 different ways to merge them together
the more difficult way is:
-> fetch the changes from the remote repo
-> merge the branches together

to fetch the changes locally
"git fetch"

"git branch"
* master

"merge" commands takes 2 different branches or codabases

"git merge origin/master"

used strategies. one of them is "Fast-Forward"
