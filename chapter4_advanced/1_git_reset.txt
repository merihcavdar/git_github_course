dealing with screw ups

There are 3 different files area in Git
-> Working dir
All the files we are looking at the VS Code

-> Staging area
When we use the "git add ." command
Can be viewed in VS Code with the Git icon in the SideBar

-> Commits
states of files in the history

"git reset" -> will remove the files from the staging area

-> let's commit a modification
"git add ."
"git commit -m "bad commit"

-> we realised that this was a bad commit and we want to go back
-> in order to do that, we should grab the id, ssh... of that commit which we can do in git log command
"git log"

-> then
"git reset 897mk89789rmyl832l24/52485mk"

-> hard way to do that, so the HEAD is adjusted, some files may have been deleted
"git reset --hard 8341ylmk48mylek7143meku
HEAD is now at 897
