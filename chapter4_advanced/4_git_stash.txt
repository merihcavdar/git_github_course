STASH allows you to save your work without commiting to the repository's history

This is useful when you work with "experimental" thing that's not worthy commiting to the history of git.

-> make some changes
-> "git stash"  : you ll see the changes are gone (the original state)
actually the changes are saved in the stash

-> "git stash pop" : the changes came back. (the most recent item in the stash array)
when used frequently, we may want to add some useful information
-> "git stash save post1"
Saved working directory and index state On master: post1

-> "git stash list"
stash@{0}: On master: post2
stash@{1}: On master: post1
stash@{2}: On master: mypost

-> "git stash apply 1"
which index to apply, add it as a parameter
