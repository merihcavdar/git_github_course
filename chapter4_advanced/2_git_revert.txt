git rever t<commit-ID> -m "reverting last commit"

you should never use "git reset" for commits that already been pushed to a remote repo on GitHub
fortunately there is still a possibility

"git add ."
git commit -m "whoops"
[master 1ded9b] whoops
1 file changed, 1 insertation (+)
create mode 100644 bad.md

to adjust this mistake
-> first list the commits
"git log"

-> get the id of the bad commit, copy that id
"git revert 6ac8mlyk734bk843yk"

similar to "git reset --hard 9mlk88"
but the difference the file "bad.md" is not lost, it's still in the commit history

Bottom line:
-> git reset: useful for local, individual projects
-> git revert: if you have a commit already pushed to a remote repo, revert is generally a better option.
