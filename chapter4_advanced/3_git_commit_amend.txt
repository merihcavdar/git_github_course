AMEND

if you make a minor mistake in Git
- maybe you forgot the stage the file before commiting
without reverting or reset

this only works in limited situations, it modifies the last commit

for instance: 
(this commit misses an unstaged file, forgotten to be added with "add")
(the other issue is that I am not happy with the commit message, it has a typo, it doesn't carry the essence of the commit)

-> git commit -am "bad message"
[master 014b89] bad message
1 file changed, 1 insertation (+)
create mode 100644 README.md

-> git commit --amend -m "better message"
the previous message has been modified

-> git add .
-> git commit --amend --no-edit
