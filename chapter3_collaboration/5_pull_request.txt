Pull Request
it is a way to contribute to another developer's repository on GitHub

-> first, find a repo on GitHub to contribute to send a pull request
-> then, fork the repo
-> it will be coppied to your own GitHub account. It will maintain a link to the UPSTREAM repo
-> create a new branch
"git branch ilikefreestuff"
"git checkout ilikefreestuff"
Switched to branch 'ilikefreestuff'

-> now it is our job to make the software better.
-> after modifications, commit to the repo
"git add ."
git commit -m "git'n a sticker"

-> now let's submit the code to our remote repo (origin is the name of our main branch on remote)
"git push origin ilikefreestuff"

-> on our GitHub account, we see the "Create Pull Request" and send our branch to the owner of the original remote repo
