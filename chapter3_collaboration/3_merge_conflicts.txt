the most scary thing -> "conflicts"
when you attempt to merge two different branches, and they modify the same code.
Git cannot figure out which one to use...

it's a very common thing and nothing to worry about.
most of the cases, it will be resolved with minimum effort.

"git merge feature" -> merges to the master branch.
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
README.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
Updating 3493k3k4

this is not a MERGE CONFLICT, rather FAILED MERGE

on the master branch, first let's commit
"git commit -am "my better feature"
[master 45lmk458] my better feature
1 file changed, 3 insertations (+), 1 deletion (-)

now try to merge:
"git merge feature"
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

in VS Code, any affected merge conflicted file would be highlighted in red with exclamation mark

the difference between the two commits can be displayed by:
"git diff"

to get back to the original state without any merging:
"git merge --abort"
