it's not a "GIT" thing, more of "GITHUB" thing
earlier, we saw "clone" example

sometimes we want to have our own version on the GitHub
when on the Fork button clicked, it will copy the repo to our own GitHub account
without affecting the original repository
at the same time it maintains a link to the original repo by that, you can fetch updates
original is called "UPSTREAM"

work on your own fork version, then send "PULL REQUEST"
Author on the original repo can review the changes, and decides whether to merge the modifications or not.
