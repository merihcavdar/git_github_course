STAGING
the most confusing thing in Git

collection is a snapshot of differences in file changes
before commiting, add the files into the portrait

"git add ." -> adding to the staging area
. -> all the files in the current directory
U changes into A
Untracked to Added (to the staging area)

"git reset ."
go back

to add just a single file
"git add README.md"
