commit -> every picturde in an album. every picture has its own unique id

git commit -m "initial commit"
"git status"
-> on branch master
-> nothing to commit, working tree clean

if we want to grab some information about the last commit:
"git log"
-> gives the unique id
-> author
-> date/time

HEAD is the most current commit on the branch

when changes are made to file/files, there is this indication "M" on the File Explorer
"M" -> "Modified"

to avoid "git add ." command, you can combine "add" and "commit" in one command which is:
git commit -a - m "fix: typo"
