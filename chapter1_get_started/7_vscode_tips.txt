click on check button to commit and then the message

when clicked on "..." drop down menu, all the git commands are listed, you dont need to type them in the terminal.
But it is recommended to be familiar with the CLI commands though.

bottom-left corner, when clicked on the "Master branch" button, all the previously created branches listed and can be switched to one of them, or a new branch can be created...

"Git Lens" plugin is recommended.
