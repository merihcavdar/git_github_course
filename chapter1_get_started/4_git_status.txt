check the status

"git status" -> for inspecting the current state of the repo

which files are added, deleted, modified and so on...

sometimes you dont want to include a file in .git repo (maybe you have secret key value you dont want to share publicly, or build files which are unnecessary to share)

create ".gitignore" -> point to other files or directiories
secret.json
node_modules/
